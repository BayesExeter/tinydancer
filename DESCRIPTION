Description: This package helps to overcome a problem often encountered during history matching, 
  but is possible during any kind of level set estimation, where the size of a target 
  space/level set is small or tiny relative to the original parameter space. Standard 
  approaches involve rejection sampling and often prove a major bottleneck in multi-wave 
  history matching workflows. The methods in this package leverage parallel tempering and 
  a custom subset simulation algorithm to generate uniform samples from tiny subspaces 
  defined as level sets of a custom function called Implausibility. See examples and 
  vignettes for more details.
